qPCR
====


     
This python script aim at calculating the Delta_Ct, Delta_Delta_Ct and FoldChange value which
produced by Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction.
    
Pandas, a python data analysis tool, is required for using this script. I use Ipython as my interpreter.
    
  
    
You need to specify the file path and file format mannually.
Different file format are supported: csv,txt et. al.
    
In addition, your should specify internal control name and expriment control name for your own data sets.
    
Last but not least, your data set struture need to be the same as my trainning data set.That's to say, 
column names must be 'Sample Name','Detector Name','Ct','Ct Mean'. But 'Ct StdEV' is optional. After this, 
you can get robust analysis.
